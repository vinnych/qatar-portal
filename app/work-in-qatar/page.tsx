const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Do I need a visa to work in Qatar?",
    a: "Yes, most nationalities require a work visa sponsored by your employer. Your employer handles the visa process — you do not apply independently. Some nationalities (GCC, UK, USA, EU) can enter visa-free for up to 30–180 days but still need a residence permit to work.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there income tax in Qatar?",
    a: "No. Qatar has zero personal income tax. Your entire salary is take-home pay. There is also no VAT on most goods and services, making Qatar one of the most tax-efficient countries for expats.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the minimum wage in Qatar?",
    a: "Qatar's minimum wage is QAR 1,000/month basic salary, plus QAR 500 food allowance and QAR 500 accommodation allowance if not provided by employer — totalling QAR 2,000/month minimum.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I change jobs in Qatar?",
    a: "Yes. Since 2020, Qatar abolished the exit permit requirement and allows job changes without employer permission after 1 year of service (or immediately in cases of employer breach). Workers can now freely change employers.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are typical working hours in Qatar?",
    a: "Standard working hours are 8 hours/day and 48 hours/week. During Ramadan, working hours are reduced to 6 hours/day for Muslim employees. Overtime is paid at 125% on weekdays and 150% on rest days and public holidays.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is end of service gratuity?",
    a: "Qatar Labour Law entitles employees to end of service gratuity: 3 weeks basic salary per year for the first 5 years of service, and 4 weeks per year thereafter. This is paid when you leave, in addition to your regular salary.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I find jobs in Qatar?",
    a: "Top job boards for Qatar include Bayt.com, GulfTalent, LinkedIn, and Naukrigulf. Many jobs are also filled through company websites and recruitment agencies. Qatar Portal aggregates daily job listings from multiple sources.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the cost of renting in Doha?",
    a: "Renting in Doha varies widely. A 1-bedroom apartment in a central area costs QAR 5,000–9,000/month. Many employers include housing allowances in the package (typically QAR 2,000–8,000/month).",
